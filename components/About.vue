        <h3>core business</h3>
        <p>Our primary focus is on developing software that operates locally, without an internet connection, 
            with no data collection or transmission, and with support for self-hosting.
        </p>

        <h3>value & mission</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to develop functional software with free versions that work well without collecting user data.
            The paid versions will be one-time purchases, with no subscriptions, and will not alter the service but
            simply enhance it, ensuring that the free version remains fully functional and not limited.
        </p>
